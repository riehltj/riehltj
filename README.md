Hello, I'm Tyler Riehl welcome to my repository!

I'm interested in Front end development and am currently learning more backend environments to become a more well rounded developer.

I'm currently learning React

I'm looking to make a career move into becoming a front end engineer, currently an aerospace engineer that's done everything from software to mechanical hardware testing.

Please send me an email at Tyler.Riehl16@gmail.com
